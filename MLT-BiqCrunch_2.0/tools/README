Before running these tests, make sure you already compiled the biqcrunch binaries (command make in the /src folder). Furthermore, the conversion scripts must be executable. If not : 

    $ chmod +x name_of_executable 

To compile and test the tools, run the following commands:

    $ make
    $ source tests.sh

To clean the binaries and the output files, run the following command:  

    $ make clean
