To compile and test BiqCrunch, run the following commands:

    $ cd src
    $ make
    $ source runtests.sh

This will put a `biqcrunch` binary in each of the problems/<PROBLEM>/
directories. Each binary is tested using the example.bc file in its directory
and the reported optimal value is compared with the known optimal value in the
example.ans file.

To clean all the binaries, run the following commands:

    $ cd src
    $ make clean
